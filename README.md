Stars.ipynb: Includes quantities that are caclulated from the analytical 2-level basis in the impact aprroximation. 
Example of such quantities is P$^{*}$, which is the pulse strength to obtain zero propagation of the Pauli $\sigma_3$ 
matrix onto itself for backwards propagation.

2DAnalyticalTomography.ipynb: Describes the tomographic sceme for the analytically soluble 2-level basis in the impact approximation
